I am currently a PhD student at Lund University under the supervision of
[Stefan Diehl](https://portal.research.lu.se/sv/persons/stefan-diehl/)
and [Manuel Solano](https://www.ing-mat.udec.cl/~msolano/).

My research interests are, broadly speaking,
- numerical analysis of PDEs,
- mathematical modelling
- and coupled problems.
