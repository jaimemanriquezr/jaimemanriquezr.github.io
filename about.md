I was born in Chile at a very young age.

For [strange reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics) I ended up moving to Sweden in 2021, where I have sporadically performed stand-up comedy and [wrote research articles]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/).

My interests are broadly set in mathematical modelling using PDEs and the development of numerical methods to approximate their solution, especially those involving multi-physics coupled problems and interdisciplinary work.
